I see her layin' by the poolside every day
She ain't got a lot on, she ain't got a lot to say
She wouldn't look my way but buddy, what do you expect
I'm just the fix-it-up boy at the apartment complex
[Pre-Chorus]
And she'll go out dancin' 'bout 7:15
Climb into the back of a long limousine
I know where she's going, she's going downtown
I'm going downtown too and take a look around
[Chorus]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm tryin' hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
[Verse 2]
I'm just sittin' 'round waitin' on a telephone call
After water pipe exploded in the livin' room wall
If your washer and dryer in need of repair
You know the handyman's waitin'

Don't move my body, it's full of resentment
The choices we make bring us to a stalemate in life when you were needed
The sordid confines of the flesh in which a misguided child finds comfort
Your comfort was needed you passed on the weekends
A few years since your departure and they speak thusly of your flesh & blood
So I ask where were you, Dad?
Sperm donor's the only name in which you are known
My house, for years, has been a broken home
Bitch, if I had the power I woulda killed you twice
Look at my life, I wanted better and I know better
Momma told me I was clever but what did you do?
Dad, where were you when Momma had to scrap with Erin?
When my sister was on the streets bleedin' out of her fuckin' pussy Don't you push me, you pussy and where's your father?
Just know I hate you, eat a fuckin' frozen dick and shit a damn glacier Misplacin' my sense of direction
Talkin to these hoes gave me a direct erection
Treatin' your momma wrong, son,I guess I got it from my dad; quite sad, isn't it?
I died over bullshit just lemme tell you I promised I would do it
Marky, don't let me fail you
Minni, don't let me deceive you
Nae Nae, I think I need you
Alex, I live and fuckin' breathe you
But go on, kid, be bigger and better than me
Kuz Lijah was no better than snorting caine, the bitch nigga with the silver tongue
The son of Dalone who never fights but he damn sure can run
And who am I? And who am I?
And who are you beneath these streetlights?
Preachin' a hermit's wisdom
Burgundy and Cerulean flags battle but you scream don't kill him They claim you soft
The woman paint you a whore, untrustworthy
The niggas paint you meek, a bitch nigga sizin' you up with the the Devil's intentions
Can I be your insight? Your haywire intuition?
Paraphrasing what demons in the dark said to me,"" Fuck me, I am Sunshine. Your baddest bitch, greatest fear, and biggest mistake.""
Dazed, I replied, ""I love you more than them but I can't. Imma father, a son, a brother.""
She gripped the nine tighter, replying,"" I love like no other. I am not Nae Nae. I am not Erika. I am not Minni, Joi, Mary or Monique. I am Sunshine.""
Seein' her true intentions as my sperm donor stood to her right and my sins to her left
I could do nothin' but take a knee
And the devil said ""Nantes, your evils are mine to keep
Please lend an ear to me
I see the twists in your hair, knots in your nappy afro
I follow you through avenues and backroads LA to Tennessee
God lies in this Hennessy
Take it to the head and take heed, you will enter me""
The streetlights guide me, broken with a bullet in my bones, and I sip the elixir foolishly
And as I lay dying to my only son I recite his father's eulogy"

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said let's pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh-oh, summer wine
[Chorus: Nancy Sinatra]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh, summer wine

My eyes grew heavy and my lips, they could not speak
I tried to get up, but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Oh-oh, summer wine

Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time

Kissed the sun, touched the moon
But he left me much too soon
His lady bird, he left his lady bird

I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird, I'll treat you good
Ah, lady bird, I wish you would
You lady bird, pretty lady bird

Lightning flashed across the sky
The night he taught me how to fly
The sun came up and then I found
Too soon he let his lady down
His lady bird, I'm his lady bird

I'm here waiting on the ground

Diddy
 and Mario Winans]
Hold up, let me answer my phone
Some bitch callin' me about some bullshit probably
I'ma call you right back, I'm doin' this mixtape right now
Now back to what I was sayin'...
I just can't believe this, man
It's just another night of these thoughts
Can't get this out of my head
Yeah
[Verse 1: Mario Winans]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself
[Chorus: Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby
I don't wanna know
Oh, oh, baby
[Verse 2: Mario Winans]
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself"

The claim we hold is as good as gold, bonanza
Hand in hand we built this land, the Ponderosa Ranch
Our birthright is this Cartwright bonanza
We here belong, and standing strong, wrong doesn't have a chance
[Chorus]
Day by day, work or play, ready side by side
Hello friend, come on in, the gate is open wide
Bound to be a fighting free bonanza
Singing pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch
[Verse 2]
Every tree and flower is part of our bonanza
The stars at night, the morning light, water in the branch
We ride along four men strong together
Every plain and ridge is our heritage, Ponderosa Ranch

By Mario Winans featuring P. Diddy
[P. Diddy - talking]
Hold up, let me answer my phone
Some bitch callin me about some bullshit probably
I'ma call you right back
I'm doin this mixtape right here
Now back to what I was sayin
[Verse 1 - Mario Winans]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself
[Chorus - Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If your playin me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if your creepin, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
[Verse 2 - Mario Winans]
Oh baby
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby keep it to yourself"

Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon, girl
Do you have any idea what you startin', girl?
You got me tinglin', come to me minglin'
Steppin off lookin' bootylicious and jinglin'
When you walk, I see it, baby (Girl)
When you talk, I believe it, baby (Girl)
I like that, thick, petite and pretty
Little touch of sidity, love to work the kitty, like (Purr)
She loves to stir it up (Purr)
I can hear her purring up
'Cause she's the type that'll get arousy of
Get you excited and call her boyfriend up (Oh)
What's the man without the plan B?
We can meet up at the Hutter house for the TV
So stand by like a butty pass
While I watch this beautiful thing shake that ass"

[Verse 1: Frida]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
[Verse 2: Frida & Agnetha]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando"
